 making a simple Calculator

Hello if you're reading this I want to explain that this is my first real coding project
I got this code of YouTube from a Creator named WEB CIFAR

I also use this links that he provided: https://codepen.io/Web_Cifar/pen/XWdVgXr so that I can get a better grasp of how the code should look 

Since this is my first time coding with no experience prior I wanted to do something simple yet still caught my attention and if you read this far thank you.
